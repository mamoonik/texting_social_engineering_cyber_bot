# Texting Social Engineering Cyber Bot

A lightweight **FastAPI-based simulation app** that mimics human-like texting behavior between a recruiter and an employee.  
Built as a realistic communication testbed for message scheduling, jittering, and humanized interaction logic.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This app demonstrates a simulated **two-way conversation** between:
- **Recruiter (AI agent)** — responds using LLM-powered logic and human-like delays  
- **Employee (user)** — interacts through a web chat interface  

The recruiter’s responses are governed by:
- Randomized micro-delays and reading times  
- Typing indicators that turn on/off naturally  
- A state machine that tracks conversation flow  
- Light telemetry for scheduled messages, jitter, and sentiment detection  

---

## 🧩 Core Features

- **FastAPI + WebSocket backend** for real-time chat simulation  
- **Human-realistic pacing** — debounce, reading delay, and random pauses  
- **Conversation state machine** (`IDLE`, `WAITING`, `REPLIED`)  
- **Mini telemetry dashboard** (`/debug/metrics`)  
- **After-hours detection** to defer messages politely  
- **In-memory scheduler** with average jitter tracking  
- **Typo simulation** to make responses appear more authentic

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Start a conversation**
   - The recruiter sends an initial message automatically when the demo loads.

2. **Employee replies**
   - When the user replies, the system schedules a response task.
   - The agent pauses, “reads,” and types back a response with realistic human timing.

3. **LLM Reply Generation**
   - Responses are generated by `generate_recruiter_reply()` (OpenAI or offline mock).

4. **Telemetry Tracking**
   - Metrics like total sent/replies, negative sentiment count, and avg jitter can be viewed at:
